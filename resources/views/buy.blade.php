<h2>Buy Early Release Edition</h2>
<p>
An 80 page early release is now available for just $15. This release includes complete drafts of chapters 1 and 2, and a 90% complete chapter 3 draft. I am working on this book full-time, and you will receive updates and improvements on a weekly basis until the book is complete. The price will increase substantially as more material is added, so save some money and start learning React now!
</p>

<p>
As with all of my popular books, your purchase is protected by a 100% money back guarantee, and <b>you'll receive free updates for life</b>.
